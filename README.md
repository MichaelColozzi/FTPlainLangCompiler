# FTPlainLangCompiler
This  Repository Contains an ongoing attempt to produce code which translates a higher-level plain language 
scripting language (largely inspired by MATLAB) into the Funky Trees XML programming language.

Along  with just streamlining notation for variable assignment as well as interacting with activators; eventually I hope
to integrate non-native complicated functionalities and built-in functions which are not directly available directly through Funky Trees. Functionalities I hope to add include:

-Function definition

-array operations

-looping structures
